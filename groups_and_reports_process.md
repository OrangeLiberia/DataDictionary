# Process and Best Practices for User Groups and Reports Creation

The below set of rules and best practices are to be followed when managing _permissions_, creating _groups_ and publishing _reports_.


## Permission Management
### How are permissions managed ?

Permissions are managed by folder. Each folder is accessible to a pre-approved list of users.  

Any addition or deletion of users has to be approved by a relevant manager.  

When first creating a folder, the _**list of users**_, _**manager's approval**_ and _**name of the folder**_ have to be communicated to MIS who will handle the permission management and folder creation on the report sever.


## Folder Nomenclature
### How should I name a group/folder ?

Each folder refers to a group of users. For clarity's sake, all folder names _must_ share the same _**three-part structure**_ :
    
    BU-"Name of the department"-"Name of the Group of users"

As shown in the following examples :



> BU-Marketing-B2B

> BU-Finance-Managers


## Report Publication
### What steps should I take when publishing a report ?

1. #### Upload the report in the folder corresonponding to the right user group :  
    Publishing a report in the wrong folder could potentially expose sensitive information to users that should not be able to access it.

2. Once the report is published, hover on the report and click on : 
    > "..." > _"More info"_ > _"Manage"_ > _"Properties"_

3. #### Choose an informative and understandable name :  
    The name of a report should give a clear indication of what it is about to a reader unaware of its content.

4. #### Add an exhaustive description :
    An exhaustive description should briefly explain the _**purpose**_ of a report, its _**ouput**_ and its _**sources**_.

###### NB : Metadata related to each report, such as _Name_, _Description_ and _Creator_ will systematically be uploaded as documentation on Github. This documentation will form a Report Catalogue where users will be able to idenfity reports depending on their needs and the information they are looking for. For this catalogue to best serve its purpose, it is thus important to follow the above guidelines closely while creating a report.
